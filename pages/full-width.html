    <h3>Biochemistry</h3>
    <p>The division of Clinical Biochemistry is the integral bridge between patients and Clinicians. It aims to understand and explain pathology at a biochemical level and develop new strategies for diagnosis and follow-up of patients by biochemical testing.
<p1>H.O.D - </p1> <p2>Dr M K Singh</p2>
Key to the successful processing for large daily volume of samples is high throughput analyzers allowing uninterrupted delivery of vital patient services. To ensure the highest standard of work we  participate in Internal Quality assurance and external quality assurance schemes. The department continued to be accreditated by NABL.

The testing results are used for clinical management of our patients. Critical alert values and sample rejections are automatic and conveyed to patients via sms on phone call Highly trained technologists perform the tests with state of art automated analyzers (necessary to provide accurate test results) such as Beckman coulter AU 680, AU5811, Abbott Architect i2000,  automated protein electrophoresis analyzers and Image 800, most of analyzers are interfaced with the HIS online for fast report generation and. In addition the lab support research and development of tests, and educational development of employees. The section also provides laboratory support to other clinical divisions for research protocol. The Department of Biochemistry is accredited by NABL under the ISO 15189 guidelines in the year November, 2005. </p>

    <h5>Radiodiagnosis</h5>
    <p>Modern imaging methods in radiodiagnosis can open a window in the human body, as it were, and supplement the clinical expertise in diagnosing the presence and extent of cancer and other diseases. The department of radiodiagnosis has a vital role to play in a tertiary referral centre for cancer such as the Tata Memorial Hospital, as it caters to the needs of several departments including the surgical, medical and radiation oncology departments. The initial diagnosis and extent of disease is the first and most important step in the management planning for a cancer patient. The department of Radiodiagnosis at Tata memorial Hospital is geared to take up this task with a dedicated team of health care professionals including Trained Radiologists, Technicians and other paramedical & support staff. Accurate staging of the disease is made possible by various imaging studies which enable the radiologist to determine the precise size and extent of tumour, possible invasion of adjacent organs or blood vessels, spread to regional lymph nodes, and whether metastases to distant sites have occurred. This information enables planning the therapy for the patient, keeping in mind the stage of the disease. The department is well equipped to provide the full range of diagnostic imaging services including Computerized Radiography, Orthopantomography (OPG), Mammography (MMG) with tomosynthesis, Ultrasonography (USG) & Colour Doppler, Multi slice Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Interventional radiology. Images from the above mentioned modalities are stored on PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System). Its activities also include Superspeciality education (DM), post-graduate education (MD), courses for technicians (Advanced Diploma in Medical Imaging Technology [ADMIT]) and clinical research.</p>
